# Project-3-VP
## Simulation for blocks of scratch using turtle module in python3.
## Loop on the blocks of pseudocode and convert it into python code then use exec() function to run this python code.
### when_key_isClicked is converted into code that fetch the key from that text and using the keyboard library in python, we can wait until user press this key.
### when_GF_isClicked is converted int code that wait for user to press g key from the keyboard.
### forever is converted into while True so that the body of it will run forever.
### if block is converted to if and condition that checks if the condition is true from the text. If there is an else block it will executed also if condition is false.
### repeat is converted into code that fetch number of times and then while loop for these times will be executed.
### repeat and wait until are converted into code that repeatedly checks if the key is pressed using the keyboard,is_pressed function.
### wait is converted into code that fetch the seconds from the text and using time.sleep(seconds) function, the running of code will wait time equals these seconds.
### Motion and looks blocks are converted into functions that use some helpers to move or display words on the screen by using turtle module in python.
### These functions and their helpers are written inside two txt files called mainFunctions and helpers respectively. Using the reading of the txt files in python we extract the functions from the two file.
### At the end, we used exec() to run the code that is stored in a string called pythonCode.
